|[2406.11706]|2024.06.17-16\:25\:55| **Prompts as Auto-Optimized Training Hyperparameters: Training Best-in-Class IR Models from Scratch with 10 Gold Labels** | Generate (synthetic) training data with 10 or less human-annotated examples | We develop a method for training small-scale (under 100M parameter) neural information retrieval models with as few as 10 gold relevance labels. The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation. | Jasper Xian, <br>Saron Samuel, <br>Faraz Khoubsirat, <br>Ronak Pradeep, <br>Md Arafat Sultan, <br>Radu Florian, <br>Salim Roukos, <br>Avirup Sil, <br>Christopher Potts, <br>[Omar Khattab]

While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query. | [Omar Khattab], <br>[Matei Zaharia]
| [2407.13885] | 2024-07-18 | **Attention in SRAM on Tenstorrent Grayskull** | Performance vs GPUs | When implementations of the Transformer's self-attention layer utilize SRAM instead of DRAM, they can achieve significant speedups. The Tenstorrent Grayskull architecture provides a large SRAM, distributed across a grid of cores. This work presents a fused kernel for Grayskull, that exclusively utilizes its large SRAM by combining matrix multiplication, attention score scaling and Softmax operations. Additionally, a dedicated Softmax kernel utilizing the SRAM and a CPU implementation serving as a baseline are presented. The Softmax operation consumes most of the runtime in the computation of attention weights from queries and keys on Grayskull. The speedup of the dedicated Softmax kernel compared to the CPU implementation is up to 10√ó, and the Softmax implementation inside the fused kernel is approximately 1.8√ó faster than the dedicated Softmax kernel. The time and memory complexity of all implementations is quadratic in sequence length. Currently, the Grayskull e150 is approximately 30√ó cheaper for the general public than an Nvidia H100 PCIe (a state-of-the-art GPU) and offers approximately 1.5√ó more SRAM. | **Moritz Th√ºning**
